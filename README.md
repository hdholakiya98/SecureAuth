# SecureAuth

This project is a Spring Boot-based authentication system designed to be scalable, secure, and cloud-ready. It provides user registration and login functionalities using Spring Security and JWT-based authentication, ensuring stateless and secure access control. The system integrates MySQL as the database, leveraging Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for efficient data management. Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt, and custom exception handling improves error management. The architecture enforces authentication through a JWT filter, validating tokens before processing requests with its robust security mechanisms and modular design.
